        <h1>Bryson Tiller</h1>
        <p>
            Bryson Tiller is the voice of the modern R&B/hip-hop blend. With his debut album "Trapsoul," he introduced
            a fresh sound that blends introspective lyrics with smooth melodies. Known for hits like "Don't" and "Exchange," Tiller's music speaks to both heartbreak and hope, capturing the complexities of life and love.
